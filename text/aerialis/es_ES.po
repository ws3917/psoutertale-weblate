msgid "<32>* Earlier, though, Alphys told us we can take the day off."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Imagine how much better it'll be to stargaze with "
"solid ground to roast on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Maybe, somewhere out there, his heart still lives on"
" in those constellations..."

"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Yeah, sometimes I wonder how a person like ya can "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I'm not judgin' ya or anything, but ya DO see the irony in that, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Our virtualasium project never got off the ground, "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... that's just a sign of things to come?"

"<32>* After all, on a new homeworld, it won't have to leave the ground."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* What a tragedy, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... it's a good thing most people don't know what ya look like up "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Ya heard me.\n"
"* Quit while ya're ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* So, ya go by \"$(moniker2)\" now, huh kid?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... that's pretty cool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Boy, ya really missed the mark on that one, huh kid?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... that's a cryin' shame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Kid, I got one question for ya, and one question "
"only."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... were ya even trying?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Hey, don't feel bad.\n"
"* Ya gave it ya best shot."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... still sucks that ya didn't make it to the end, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Gee, talk about cuttin' it close, huh kid?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's an ending for the ages!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Ya did pretty well for someone with no real "
"practice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... beginner's luck, perhaps?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Workin' at the lab is a treat, I tell ya."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Have ya ever been inside the virtualasium?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Wonderful place.\n"
"* Though they say ya shouldn't go out of bounds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Why don't ya go find someone else to bully, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I only hope we can expand our userbase past that one"

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* If they did, ya'd be in some deep doo-doo by now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Or don't.\n"
"* Just don't make me say I told ya so, ya got me?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* It's not like I had a moniker at ya age or anything."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* It's a wonder ya even made it here at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Kinda seems like ya weren't."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Ya might get another chance on the next episode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Maybe next time ya could, I dunno, win more "
"comfortably?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Or maybe MTT just went a little easy on ya."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Yeah, ya heard that right.\n"
"* Out of bounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now what the heck is that supposed to mean?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Don't worry about me, school went well today."

msgid "<32>* I'm just really looking forward to MTT's next show!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Do you know when it'll be on?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* That show was amazing!\n"
"* The human almost looked real this time!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Wait, have I seen you before?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ack, what a letdown.\n"
"* To think he'd cancel his big show just like that..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Did you... do that?\n"
"* Did you kill Mettaton for real?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* No... it has to be fake.\n"
"* Mettaton's just too popular to die!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* So the human WAS real...\n"
"* Wow, Mettaton must be REALLY good at networking!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Your performance was great, by the way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Mettaton usually has a schedule, but he forgot to make one "
"this time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I swear you look like the actor Mettaton brought on..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Oh well, maybe next time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I can't believe I almost fell for it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I can't believe I didn't notice you were a human before!"

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I'm a reporter!\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I'm gonna lose my marbles!!\n"
"* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I'm a reporter!\n"
"* Today's news story is about death 'n' destruction!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Did ya know someone's been killed right in front of me??\n"
"* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I'm a reporter!\n"
"* Today's news story is about metal 'n' magic!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Did ya know Mettaton's actually made of it??\n"
"* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Did ya know I'm likely goin'a die in a few short hours??\n"
"* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Oh dear!\n"
"* I really do love my job!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Who, me?\n"
"* Someone who'd evacuate?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Never.\n"
"* I only went with them because they said I had to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I get that you were some kinda bully or something..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... but it's not as if you were going to kill me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Everyone else around here's been invited to that "
"hangout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But me?\n"
"* I'm not even interested."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Sure, I'm glad you went and saved us and all..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... but that doesn't mean I have to stand around and indulge in the "
"Madrigal plant."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Poor, poor Mettaton, whatever will you do."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Oh, that's right.\n"
"* Nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* For once, Mettaton did the right thing, and "
"cancelled a show."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That grand finale wouldn't have ended well for him."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Why?\n"
"* Just a feeling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I was one of the builders of the ORIGINAL fountain "
"here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Y'know.\n"
"* Before Mettaton decided to rebuild the whole thing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Like, who does that? Who'd rebuild it all just to change a single, "
"tiny detail?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of petty if you ask me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I can't BELIEVE Mettaton's running his TV shows when"
" there's a killer on the loose."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Does he not see how dangerous that could be?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Someone's going to end up getting killed doing that nonsense."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of idiotic if you ask me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Like, really, people?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Did you seriously think I'd want to run away like that?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Come on.\n"
"* I'm not THAT soft."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... ugh, never mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n"
"* I've never been one for parties."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* My main hobbies and interests consist primarily..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... of pointing out and picking apart poor imitations."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Like this fountain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* As far as I'm concerned, this is all his fault."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He got too over-confident, and he paid the price."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Too bad, so sad, be glad I'm not your dad."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* The more he stays out of our lives, the better."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'd ask him never to show up again, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... then I wouldn't have anything to be upset about."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n"
"* I'm not the only one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Ever heard of a \"Mr. Sepluv?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah, he was in charge of the original build project here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But now... he sells moon rocks for a living."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n"
"* I'm standing out here, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So I guess I'm just as guilty."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Embarrassing, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Pointless, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Ironic, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Finally got outta school, I don't know why I still "
"go there anymore..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Luckily, I hear Mettaton's got something exciting planned for his next"
" show."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I can't wait, brah..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Brah... that was crazy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And... kinda weird?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I mean, some of that stuff looked like junk, but that last item..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... hot diggity damn!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I'm ruined, brah...\n"
"* Mettaton just uppin' cancelled his latest show."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now what excuses will I have to skip class...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Brah.\n"
"* I'm feeling pretty hurt about Mettaton's death."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I'll have an excuse to skip classes for a little while, but after "
"that, I'm ruined!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Brah.\n"
"* I'm glad Mettaton's staying around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If it weren't for him, I'd have way less excuses to skip class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I hope he gets interesting contestants this time..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Tell me YOU wouldn't want a life-sized sci-fi anime "
"doll."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* It's a cryin' shame, brah."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Real inconsiderate, Mettaton.\n"
"* Real inconsiderate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* As a matter of fact, I'm skipping one right now..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* They say things can get pretty weird if you go too "
"far out in these repeating rooms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Time tunnels...\n"
"* Invariant spatial flexures..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Eh, don't ask me what any of that means, I just overheard Alphys one "
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* If it wasn't her saying it, I'd probably just think it was made up..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* As long as you can still see clearly, you're "
"probably fine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* You've been a bully in the past, but you might've "
"redeemed yourself..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We just came back to ask, were you really being yourself?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Not everybody likes you, and some are still afraid..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But I guess that's how it goes when you've got violence in your veins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* When we get to the new homeworld, we're comin' out "
"straightforward."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* With bars and rhymes so toward they'll beat other writers to their "
"foreword."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* For anyone who challenges us, we've got but four words..."

msgid "<32>* This is our world."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Vulkin and I make up the rap group \"The "

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* ... hmm, maybe the teenagers weren't so bad."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* ... at least it's not hugging me like the teenagers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I am starting to think that my pity for Gyftrot was "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* They might've been scared..."

msgid "<33>* But at least they could finally live puzzle-free."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* The new homeworld's gonna be a riot, chief."

msgid "<32>* Can you take a guess why?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* That's right.\n"
"* No crappy puzzles to be solved."

msgid "<32>* You get me, chief?"

msgid "<32>* If you don't know someone personally, why be all upset?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* You know why I love hanging out here?"

msgid "<32>* It's simple, chief."

msgid "<32>* There's no crappy puzzles to figure out here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Yeah, you heard me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I'd rather be afraid for my life than have to deal with those puzzles."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's just how it is, chief."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Yeah, I STILL said it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I STILL said crappy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It'll ALWAYS be a fact, chief."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I'm just being honest."

msgid "<32>* Most of us don't really know who he is as a person."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's just a fact, chief."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Yeah, I said it."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I'm an art teacher.\n"

msgstr ""

"<32>* It hurts to look at...\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I'm an art teacher.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Wouldn't that be nice?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Why can't everyone just make nice things all the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Why is teaching a subjective subject so objectively "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* So. A new homeworld, eh?\n"
"* My son and I will get to do so many great things together."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* So many great things.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Then, we'll go to dinner, and the movies... and his father can come "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Growing boys have so many needs, don't they?\n"
"* So it's only fair."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder if my son's friends would be interested...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Did something happen?\n"
"* I've been so focused on this here game, I hadn't noticed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But that's fine, you see.\n"
"* The game is too important to abandon it now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* All the lights went out a little while ago, you see.\n"
"* So I'm in a bit of a pickle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* If I forfeit now, my opponent might return and steal the win out from "
"under my feathers!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Well. I sat at this here table.\n"
"* And organized this here game.\n"
"* But my opponent?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Nowhere! Nowhere to be seen in this fine establishment!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Well. I played this here move.\n"
"* Pawn to king's knight four?\n"
"* So my opponent walked off."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Now, you see, I have to wait.\n"
"* It'll take a while for that clock to run out, for sure."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Fun for the whole family."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* All that matters is the game."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* You never know what sorts of tricks your opponents "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* It's a true disappointment.\n"
"* Immeasurable, even."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* There's no way I can chronologically recover from "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Yah may have scared us off, but at least yah saved "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Can't say I'm not a little afraid of yah though."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Apology or not, yah more than made up for mah son's "
"injuries."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Thank yah for yah kind deed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Now that we're free, being a waitah may no longer "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Our Son's returned, so I'll have to find mahself a new job..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Everything around here is falling apart now.\n"

msgid "<32>* They've stopped coming to eat at our fancy restaraunt..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* In favah of fast food."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Of course, I'm also a fathah.\n"

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Just try to be kindah from now on, will yah?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Thank yah very much."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Just prahmise yah will."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* At least the jokes are funny."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Security left for the party a while ago, but I "

msgid ""
"<32>* After all, why go anywhere else, when you can take in the aura..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... of a wish flower..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I was bored, so I started taking in the wish "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* This one's not TOO bad, but there might be a better one somewhere "
"else..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... maybe I'll stumble across that one later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Security kicked me out for taking in the wish "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* That famous guy has everyone distracted, so I could probably go back "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* The lights went off a while ago, so I could probably go back in..."

msgid "<32>* The guards have clocked out, so I could probably go back in..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... but, ahh, this here's the best one I've found so far..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Don't worry about me, I'm just here... taking in a "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* After all our hard work, we've made it out alive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Frankly, I'm tired of this job.\n"
"* But it's been a good run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Maybe, when we get to the new homeworld, I'll be a factory worker "
"instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And don't tell me that's the same thing as bein' a CORE worker."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* For one, we won't have those two girls breathin' down our necks all "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* No, Catty, I don't want to sleep over with ya!\n"
"* End of story!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Long ago, they found a weak spot in the force field,"
" about where the Outlands is now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* It doesn't mean we can escape through it, but it does mean any human "
"who comes here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... will have to crash-land right around that area."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* So we built the outpost to be long and winding to slow down a "
"potential invasion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* We quickly realized it was a dumb idea, but by then, it'd become a "
"tradition."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now, you can't go two seconds without getting lost..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* She's always been gettin' up on my case like that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Eh...\n"
"* I guess it could be worse."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We could still be workin' for that dumb robot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* At least the CORE wasn't designed with this idea."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Can you imagine how bad it'd be if we had to go through mazes to do "
"maintenance?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Go on, you two..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Let's just be glad it's over."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Please and no thank you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* So looks like my job is over.\n"
"* No more CORE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Actually, yes more core.\n"
"* But not for us no more."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Any time now, we leave, and we never return."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* What will my future be?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Boy, do I sure wish I knew!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I work at the CORE.\n"
"* The floor plan is designed to look like a bird."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Oh! I bet you don't know what \"CORE\" stands for!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It stands for \"Charged Onium- ion Refactorization Engine.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* What does it mean?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I have no idea, no idea at all!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Perhaps, in an alternate timeline, I could be king."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It is I the good King Charles at your service!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Wouldn't that be nice!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Something else that's cool about the CORE is the "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I sure do love PUZZLE!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* Could be worse, though."

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* No security field...?"

msgid "<16>* He said he was \"done seeking love\" or whatever."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* Kinda sounds like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* Sorta feels like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/8}* He TOTALLY saw us as a fantasy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* He DEFINITELY had a crush on us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/4/5}* Too bad he never asked us out, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/5}* Catty, we would have said no."

msgid "<16>{#k/2/0}* The humans?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* Oh yeah, Alphys totally had us adopt one."

msgid "<16>{#k/7/5}* ... they'll wake up eventually."

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/2/6}* I wonder what they'll have to say about that \"archive\" "

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* Yeah, THAT thing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/4}* Isn't that where Asgore was keeping ALL the humans?"

msgid "<16>* How was that even POSSIBLE!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/4/4}* Oh my god.\n"
"* Alphys."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* Oh my god, ALPHYS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/8}* She used to live in our housing spire!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* She was like a big sister!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* I mean, like, if your big sister..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/2}* ... takes you on rip- roaring interstellar trash hunts!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* She showed us the coolest ways to find stuff."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* She built up a WICKED sci-fi collection."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/4}* Then she became the royal scientist..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/0/5}* ... she doesn't really have time for trash-hunting anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/6}* So Alphys has always been, like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* ... super duper smart."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/4}* Like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* UNNATURALLY smart."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* Like, she can calculate a derivative in her head..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/2}* ... in five seconds FLAT!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* It's MEGA impressive and all..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/2/5}* ... but as a result, she struggles with her impulses "
"sometimes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/1/6}* I remember that time she called in half the Royal Guard..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/4}* ... when she thought she saw some \"interesting trash.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* It's like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* She doesn't process things the way most people do."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/8}* But we love her for that, don't we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* But we still think she's A-MAZ-ING!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/4/0}* So like... OBVIOUSLY Asgore made her the royal scientist."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/2}* Oh, for sure!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* Oh right, THAT goofy goober."
msgstr ""

msgid "<17>{#k/0/8}* Oh yeah, THAT furry fuzzball!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/0}* So like, here's the thing about Asgore..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* ... he's one of the NICEST guys you'll ever meet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/0}* But, at the same time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/4}* ... the stuff everyone wants him to do..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/4/5}* ... it's kind of gross."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* ... it's just plain awful."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* I heard Undyne lobbied to expand the Royal Guard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/2/6}* Yeah, didn't Asgore, like, not even want one to begin with?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/4}* ... the stuff you've been up to out there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/4/5}* ... well, it's making his job a little tougher."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* ... well, it's making his life a little harder."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* Like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* ... maybe try NOT to kill anyone else, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/3/6}* Gosh.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/3/2}* Yeah, we should TOTALLY squeeze the life outta him later!"

msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/8}* Catty, no!"
