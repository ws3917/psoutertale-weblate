"<26>{#f/16}* I tried talking to my parents, but they couldn't help me at "

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* ... but it didn't work."

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/16}* ... then...\n"

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Just as it all flashed before my eyes..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* I suddenly found myself back where I started."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* Where were we again?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#f/6}* ... oh yeah.\n"
"* So I was right back where I started."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* At first, I didn't know how I got there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... so, I tried bringing myself back on purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* I focused my mind on going back again, and... it worked."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Somehow, I'd gained the power to turn back time."

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* And that's when it struck me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* I'd use my new power to be a force for good."

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* I thought, maybe, if I couldn't help myself..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* At least I could help someone else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/16}* ... oh yeah.\n"
"* So I started out by helping them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/23}* I'll admit, I struggled at first..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... but the more I did it, the better I got."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* After a while, I could even do it with my eyes closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/9}* Heck.\n"
"* Sometimes I did."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* And, sure, maybe I was a bit of a show-off..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* But what did it matter?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* After all, I was still helping them..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... saving them..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Being a good person, and all."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Like I said before, I started out by helping them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Soon, though, I began to notice something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* The same responses, the same outcomes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/16}* Just being nice all the time wasn't satisfying me anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* And, yes, before you ask, I did try getting cutesy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* But even that became boring in the end."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* I could've gone on, but what would've been the point?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* It was time to try something else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Like I said before, I decided I'd stop being nice "
"all the time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* Now, it didn't amount to much at first..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Just a few mean words here and there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/10}* A part of me felt bad, but what did I really have to lose?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/6}* Of course, once things began to repeat again, I got a little "
"meaner."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Another insult here, another mockery there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Eventually, I stopped feeling bad about it entirely."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* It's not like I was killing them or anything."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* Like I said before, I'd gotten used to being mean."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Then, I thought to myself... if I attacked them..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* It'd be fine, as long as they didn't die."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/10}* What'd be the harm?\n"
"* Monsters can heal, can't they?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/4}* If worst came to worst, I could just RESET, and it'd still be "
"fine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* ... little did I know how I'd react if it actually happened."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Like I said before, I'd gotten the idea to attack "
"them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* I guess you could say I got carried away..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Pulled... just a little too tightly..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ..."
msgstr "<25>{#f/16}* ..."

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* My own mother, strangled to death by my own magic..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Begging me to stop as the life drained out of her body."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Even after a RESET, the image wouldn't leave my mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/13}* I panicked, and tried making up for it by being nice to her."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* But I couldn't forget about what I'd done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/15}* I just... couldn't look at her... at anyone... the same way "
"again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Like I said before, I couldn't forget about what "
"I'd done."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* And, after that, things only got worse."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* After that, things only got worse."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#f/15}* I guess, after screwing up once, it got easier to do it again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/15}* And soon, be it out of frustration, or raw curiosity..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/16}* What began as an accident spiraled out of control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#f/7}* But, hey, when it came down to it, I could always RESET, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/6}* And once I told myself THAT... there really was no going back."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* With each new RESET, my actions became more and more"
" twisted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/7}* I subjected them... all of them... to horrors beyond compare."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* I did it again, and again, and again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* I did it so many times, I'd become completely numb to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Then, finally, after all of that..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* ... nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* I felt nothing.\n"
"* It meant nothing.\n"
"* It was all for nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/15}* As I stood alone in my empty world, I knew what had to be done."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/23}* So I RESET, and let time move forward without me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Like I said before, I knew it was all for nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* So I RESET, and let time move forward without me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* Don't you see, $(name)?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/23}* This is why I was so excited to be with you after all this "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* With you by my side, I won't have to do it alone anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/15}* With you by my side... it'll finally mean something for once."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* Besides, this is what you've always wanted, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* To \"set them free?\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/23}* ... heh.\n"
"* We really do make the perfect team."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* Just remember, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/17}* As long as we stick together, nothing can stand in our way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* ... here.\n"
"* Take my hand."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Don't worry, I'll hold the cup for you..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* We might as well do it while we still have the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* They tried to help me..."

msgid "<32>* They tried to make me feel at home..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Monsters are like children in that way..."

msgid "<32>* Their innocence is what defines them."

"<25>{#f/4}* huh?\n"

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You told Sans the secret codephrase.)"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* what? a codephrase?\n"
"* can you speak a little louder?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You told Sans the secret codephrase, but louder.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* did you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* ... just say to \"reverse the polarity of the neutron flow?\""
msgstr ""

"<25>{#f/2}* wow.\n"
"* i can't believe you would say that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* not only is that complete nonsense..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* it's also my secret codephrase."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* so... you really are a time traveler, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* well, alright.\n"
"* i guess that means you're qualified."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* here's the key to my room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (The Skeleton Key was added to your keyring.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* it's time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* you walked back out from behind that pillar."

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* you understood the {@fill=#003cff}real truth{@fill=#fff}."

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* wow, you really ARE a time traveler."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#s/equip}{#p/human}* (The Skeleton Key was added to your keyring.)"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* behind you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}* so this is it, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* this is where your journey ends?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>* look.\n"
"* i don't know what asgore's going to do."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/0}* i had a talk with him about what you've done, but, chances "

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ... it won't be what you expect."

msgid "<25>* but, just think for a moment..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* everything you've done up until now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* was it worth it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i don't know what's going through your mind right now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* i mean, i can't even see your face."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* ..."
msgstr "<25>* ..."

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* maybe that's for the best."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* but i do know that for you to have done all this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* you had to have cared about us at some point, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* ... i guess there's every chance that's not true."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* still, people don't just act like this towards strangers."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* i'll bet somewhere, deep down, you really do care about us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* you certainly cared enough to make it this far, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i know. the whole \"appeal to emotion\" isn't really my"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* but what else am i supposed to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* when someone goes as far as you have..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* intimidation just doesn't seem appropriate anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* so i'm trying something different."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* now.\n"
"* if this is really how it ends..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* so be it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* kindness isn't exactly your thing, and i get that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>* but if, by chance, you've got a {@fill=#ff0}certain "
"power{@fill=#fff}..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* then why not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* just this once, just at the end..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* just be kind."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* well."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* that's all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysCutscene1}* You made it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#g/alphysCutscene2}* ...\n"
"* So this is Archive Six."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/15}* Ever since it was built, the humans have been guided here..."

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Held in stasis..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It's incredible what Professor Roman was able to achieve!"

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysInquisitive}* Having second thoughts...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asgore}{#f/1}* This is the force field."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* It is what keeps us trapped on the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* An unthinking, unfeeling boundary..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Through which nobody, monster or otherwise, may pass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asgore}{#f/1}* For many years, I lamented that we would never reach "

msgstr "<25>{#f/1}* ..."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* Alphys has already informed me of your... violent tendencies."

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Though, she did say you spared plenty of our kind as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/16}* ...\n"
"* Tell me, young one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/12}* Did it begin as self- defense, and devolve into something "

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Or was this your plan from the start?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* ..."
msgstr "<25>{#f/5}* ..."

msgid ""
"<26>{#f/16}* Regardless.\n"
"* You place me in a difficult position."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* To trust you with our one key to freedom..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/16}* Or to take your SOUL by force, and enter the archive myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* As terrible as you may have been, I do not wish to harm you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* You could have been far worse to us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* ... yet you were not."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It would be wrong to assume that you are irredeemable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* You may simply be a very frightened young child."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* Words cannot express how unfortunate this situation has become."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* All things considered, you have behaved well."

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* It is fortunate you were captured and delivered here quickly."

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/2}* The outpost can be a dangerous place, as I am sure you are "

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* I only have myself to blame for this."

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/2}* My keeping of secrets has made it difficult to escort you "

msgid "<25>* ... now, it is now your turn to make that same choice."

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* The kind one..."

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* And the one who sought justice above all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* When given the choice to stay, or to enter the archive..."

msgid "<25>* They all eventually chose the latter."
msgstr ""

"<25>{#f/5}* ... now, regardless of the circumstances in which you arrived..."

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is your turn to make that same choice."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asgore}{#f/1}* In any case, I cannot ask you to enter the archive."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I will decide what to do with you later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asgore}{#f/6}* As the last to enter, you would act as a vessel."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>* With all powers combined, you will\n"
"  destroy the force field."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Then..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Monsterkind will search for a new home planet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ... however."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asgore}{#f/2}* ... I understand."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/1}* Perhaps it was wrong of me to assume you would be like the "

"<25>{#f/5}* You did arrive quickly, and I have done little to earn your "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/5}* You may not be ready, and I have done little to earn your trust."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* If you change your mind, you may return to me here..."
