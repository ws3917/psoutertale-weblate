msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* ... well, before that, I'd like to tell you how I "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/20}* So... it all started when you left the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/22}* I found out what you'd done, and I... stormed the "
"Citadel myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/22}* Alphys was in shock.\n"
"* The king was dead, and the guard was gone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/20}* Plus, after whatever she and Mettaton tried to do to"
" stop you..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/22}* The outpost's power systems started acting like "
"crazy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/19}* The atmosphere, the gravity... these things we "
"depend on..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/19}* They all started going haywire, resulting in "
"countless deaths."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/18}* Without a Royal Guard, we couldn't evacuate them to "
"safety."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* Then, to top it off, a massive power surge hit the "
"archive HARD."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/19}* The humans within were killed instantly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/10}* ...\n"
"* I got what ASGORE was going for with it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/10}* A way to set us free, that didn't involve us killing"
" anyone?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* ... heh.\n"
"* It was very... him."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/19}* But after that power surge, ASGORE's plan had "
"failed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/20}* So with the human SOULs in front of me, and the "
"kingdom falling..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/20}* ..."
msgstr "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/20}* ..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* Not to interrupt, but I think we found what you were"
" l-looking for."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* Is that so?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Let me see that..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* ..."
msgstr "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* ..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/18}* ...\n"
"* Is that right!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/9}* Tch.\n"
"* \"Is that right.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/11}* Are you kidding me?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* ..."
msgstr "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* ..."

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/8}* OF COURSE IT'S RIGHT!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/7}* So, after I gathered up the human SOULs..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/11}* Alphys and I came up with a plan to save EVERYONE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* We'd take a shuttle past the force field, hunt you "
"down..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/7}* And TEAR the SOUL from your body!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Then, we'd go back, and blast the force field to "
"pieces!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* Only problem is, how would we find you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/15}* W-well, I can answer THAT question."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/16}* After all, I was the one who came up with the "
"solution!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/26}* It's simple, really.\n"
"* By answering this VERY phone call..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{|}{#p/alphys}{#f/18}* We've been able to triangulate your- {%}"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}UNDYNE!?\n"
"ARE YOU OKAY!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/2}* ...!?"
msgstr "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/2}* ¿¡...!?"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/13}* Huh??\n"
"* What are YOU doing here?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}WELL... I HEARD A LOT OF SCREAMING.\n"
"AND SHOUTING."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/14}* Aw, thanks Papyrus.\n"
"* How considerate of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}OH, YOU'RE WELCOME!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/7}* Maybe NEXT time, don't sneak onto SOMEONE ELSE'S "
"SHUTTLE!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}I-I'M SORRY, I WAS CURIOUS, OKAY??"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}I JUST WENT TO LOOK, AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}THE SHUTTLE STARTED FLYING OFF THE OUTPOST!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}BELIEVE ME, I WOULD'VE RATHER STAYED BEHIND."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/15}* Okay, uh, I don't know if you can tell, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* We're in the middle of a situation here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* Yeah, you should... probably go back to hiding "
"again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Think of it like a game of hide-and-go seek!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}AND HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO HIDE!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* I don't know???"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/17}* Two hours.\n"

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}OKAY!!\n"
"GOOD LUCK THEN!!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* ... is two hours gonna be enough to catch the human,"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/14}* Pfft, two HOURS?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Yeah, I don't think so."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/7}* You've already FALLEN for it, punk!"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/16}* No matter where you go, there's no escape!!"

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/17}* Head of the royal pain- in-the-butt society."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/28}* ... may I interest you in a tragic backstory today?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/5}* So I was going about my business, looking after the "
"archive..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* When, suddenly, I hear a spacecraft taking off."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#ffbbdc}* Huuuuge spacecraft."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/17}* Uh, not really.\n"
"* It was just a shuttle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#ffbbdc}* Oh.\n"
"* Tiny spacecraft."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/15}* Yeah, and Asgore was NOWHERE to be found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* I checked his house, I checked the royal annex..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* ... then, I noticed the power fluctuations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* Turns out Mettaton was being stupid and wasted it "
"all fighting you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/25}* So now, the outpost was running on practically "
"nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#d4bbff}* Oh my god, what happened next?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/26}* ..."
msgstr "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/26}* ..."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#d4bbff}* Oh, right, you totally freaked out and called"
" Undyne."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/18}* ... and when she got there, she told me Asgore was "
"dead!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/3}* Because that's DEFINITELY what I wanted to hear."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#ffbbdc}* Like, for sure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/13}* I mean, she did at least call the Royal Guard..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* To help stabilize the CORE and stop anyone from "
"getting hurt."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/30}* But what she did next was... WAY worse than I "
"expected."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#d4bbff}* Is... is this where..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/31}* Where Undyne found the archive, and killed the "
"humans inside."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/32}* In that moment, I didn't know WHAT to feel anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#ffbbdc}* Gosh, I don't blame you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#d4bbff}* It's like she was only thinking about "
"herself!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/17}* She said she \"got\" what Asgore was going for..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* But that she \"couldn't allow it to go on.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/13}* ...\n"
"* I was pretty upset about it, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* At least we still just needed one more SOUL.\n"
"* We still had hope."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#ffbbdc}* ... until you didn't."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* Right.\n"
"* Until we didn't."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* Because Undyne, in her INFINITE WISDOM..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/22}* Had NO FREAKING IDEA HOW TO STORE THE HUMAN SOULS "
"PROPERLY."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#d4bbff}* And now they're all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* ... gone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* At that point, I just gave up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/8}* I didn't care what she did after that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* I quit my job.\n"
"* Threw my experiments in the garbage."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/33}* And then..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#ffbbdc}* You came back to us."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#d4bbff}* You became an interstellar trash hunter "
"again!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/29}* That's right."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/28}* And I'm GOOD at it.\n"
"* Heck, I'm the best in the business."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{@fill=#ffbbdc}* Now there's a fact if I've ever heard one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* Like, honestly, who CARES about getting out of here "

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* Well, Undyne can lie to them all she wants."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* She can build her arms factories, and her "

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* it's been a while, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* after you left, alphys... kind of went into a panic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* not only were asgore and undyne gone..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but due to a botched plan involving mettaton and the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* the outpost's power systems were in total disarray."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* both the atmosphere and the gravity broke down.\n"
"* it... wasn't pretty."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* just from her call, i could tell things were pretty "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but by the time i got to the citadel..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* a power surge killed the humans in the archive as well."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... i'd never seen her in worse shape."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* still, i knew from back when we were lab partners..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* that she had what it took to overcome anything."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* so i sat with her, and gave her a chance to process it "
"all..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* and by the end, she\n"
"  took responsibility and accepted asgore's crown."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... right away, we knew we'd have to protect the human "
"souls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* so, we repurposed some old lab junk and built a "
"containment system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* after that, we realized we'd need someone to guard it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* when the former queen returned, shortly thereafter..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* she seemed like the ideal candidate."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but then, she saw the human souls for herself..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* and just went on a tirade about us being \"part of his "
"agenda.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* we tried to explain what happened, and that asgore was "
"innocent..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* but she wasn't having it in the slightest."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* needless to say, she declined the job."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* luckily, the same couldn't be said about papyrus."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* after toriel declined, i called him next, and... well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* luckily, since papyrus was around, i called him up, "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* he pretty much took the job on the spot."

"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i can understand defending yourself against the royal "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* and, even outside of that, you were mostly alright."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... but, there was one person you killed..."

msgid ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* before you struck him down and declared your true "

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* someone who would have never hurt you, no matter what."

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* asgore was gone, undyne was gone..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* and due to a botched plan involving mettaton and the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* issues with the power occured, killing many in the "

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* long story short, alphys and i put their souls in a "

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* a former elite squad member..."

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* the moment they were left alone with the souls..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* they took them, and turned themselves from a dummy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* into mad mew mew, from mew mew starfire."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* also known as the best movie in the mew mew franchise."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* which i definitely didn't say because i'm afraid for my"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* anyway, as you can tell, things are just wonderful "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* rather than doing any important work, we all just play "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... which we definitely aren't forced into doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i mean, hey.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* no, really.\n"
"* that's not even a lie."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* 'cause, even when she acts like she WANTS them to be "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* it's like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* something within her won't let her go that far."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* something stops her.\n"
"* she hesitates, or even backpedals at times."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* there was this one time where, she had an idea..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* for a game where we'd all fight to the death in rounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but just as the match was about to start..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* she changed the rules to make it a fight to knockout "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* so...\n"
"* if i had to guess..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* i'd say the human souls gave her more than she "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* maybe some part of them remains conscious...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/17}* Uh, not to interrupt, but it's your move."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* huh?"
msgstr "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ¿eh?"

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/18}* The game's all in your hands now!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... i see."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i guess i better get out there, then."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* That would probably be a good idea."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* For all our sakes."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but before i go."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* if this call ever reaches you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i suggest not letting another human get near us."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* mew mew's planning something big.\n"
"* i can feel it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* if she succeeds, the whole galaxy might be in danger."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* ... just thought i'd give you a heads up."

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* Come on, let's go!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i'm on my way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* so, after you left, things weren't too great at first."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/4}* but who would we hire to watch over them?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* well, of all the people we called, only charles took "
"the job."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* a little mouse with a spotless service record at the "
"core."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* now, charles had worked at the core for so long..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* that it grew accustomed with its routine."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* take a power cell out, put a new one back in..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* except now, instead of power cells, it was human souls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... so, when it accidentally absorbed those souls..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* it was only because charles was just doing what it knew"
" best."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i know.\n"
"* it sounds bad."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* without the human souls, how would we escape?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but when that little mouse realized its new godlike "
"power..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* it used that power to make everyone's dreams come true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}HELLO, HUMAN!\n"
"IT IS I, THE GREAT PAPYRUS!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}WHAT!?!?\n"
"YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/7}... UGH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS!\n"
"I COULD NEVER DIE!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}FOR I HAVE BEEN RE-INCARNATED..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}BY OUR ONE TRUE OVERLORD, KING CHARLES!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... so, as you can see, there's no reason for anyone to"
" be sad."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* who cares about leaving the outpost, am i right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}YEAH, WE DON'T NEED TO SEE THE STARS!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}WE'RE LIVING OUT OUR BEST LIVES RIGHT HERE!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* my thoughts exactly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... anyway, thanks for being the reason all of this "
"happened."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* if you ever get bored of flying around out there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* just know you're always welcome to return."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}YEAH, THEN YOU CAN LIVE OUT YOUR BEST LIFE, TOO!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* heh.\n"
"* we can only hope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* the royal guard had to rush to fix the outpost's power "
"systems."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* alphys called me, and asked me to come up and meet her."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* when i got there, i could tell she wasn't doing well."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... after that, things seemed to settle down."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/human}{#v/4}{@fill=#d535d9}* Sans, do we get to go to the swimming "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#v/5}{@fill=#00c000}* It's okay if you can't take us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* woah there, what's got you kids all worked up?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* sure, i can take ya.\n"
"* after i'm all done on the phone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#v/4}{@fill=#d535d9}* Deal."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* Ahah, s-sorry about that, I..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* I... had to attend a meeting with the Royal Defense "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* Come on guys, let's let Sans finish his phone call."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#v/4}{@fill=#d535d9}* Alright."
msgstr "<32>{#p/human}{#v/4}{@fill=#d535d9}* Esta bien."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ..."
msgstr "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* after alphys became queen, she started making some "
"changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* for one, the royal guard became the royal defense "
"agency."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* a technologically- oriented version of the royal guard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* they've got high-tech visors, long-range tracking..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* perfect for finding and escorting whatever kid crash-"
"lands here next."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* heck, even papyrus landed a position with 'em."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* he's the leader of a squadron tasked with handling the "
"more..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* and the original royal guards from before the rebrand?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* they put together a squadron tasked with handling the "
"more..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... rowdy types."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* we learned a lot about those since you were here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* the defense agency's got people analyzing your data "
"every day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* looking for patterns, finding weak points..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* with any luck, we won't have to use them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but... you never know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}HELLO, SANS!\n"
"BEEN UP TO ANYTHING LATELY?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* eh, not really."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* you on break right now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}INDEED I AM!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}I DON'T TAKE BREAKS OFTEN, SO..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}I MIGHT AS WELL USE THE ONES I DO WISELY."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* hmm... lemme guess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* was alphys the one who made you take it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE IN THE MATTER."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}ANYWAY, THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH BREAK TIME."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}BACK TO WORK NOW!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* huh?\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}NO TIME TO LOSE!!\n"
"A HUMAN COULD ARRIVE ANY SECOND!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... well, you're right."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* it'd just be nice if you weren't so busy anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* at least alphys seems to have a lot of free time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* since, when the former queen returned..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/4}* she offered to help look after the humans."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* at least the humans who came before you are pretty "
"cool."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* heck, when the former queen returned..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/4}* she even offered to help look after them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* she still thinks asgore was a bad person, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* maybe one day, she'll forgive him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* it's hard to tell."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... though, i know one person she'll never forgive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* at least he's happy.\n"
"* he really enjoys what he does."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* which is more than i can say about a lot of people "
"these days."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* which is good, because not everyone can say the same."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* life's been kind of lonely lately, you know?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* not just for me, but for a lot of people these days."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* not everyone has the luxury of carrying on like nothing"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* S-sans, I'm sorry.\n"
"* But you have to take the kids to the pool."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/3}* They're driving me crazy back here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... welp."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i guess i'll let alphys finish this one off for me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/27}* Finish what off?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* ..."
msgstr "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* ..."

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* So it's you."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* Well.\n"
"* He said he was planning on calling you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/25}* Personally, I don't have much to say."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/25}* You're a killer, a coward, and better off gone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* And no matter what good you do now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* And worst of all..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/25}* You might not have killed many people, but you're "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* No matter what good you do now, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* Worst of all, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/25}* It'll never make up for the damage you've already "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* ..."
msgstr "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* ..."

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* On behalf of everyone living on the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/25}* You killed someone important to my closest friend."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* On his behalf..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/16}* I hope you fall into a black hole and die."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* hey"
msgstr "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oye"

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* is anyone there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* i think... there's something i need to tell you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* if it's not too much trouble."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* so, even before you left the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* things were already going downhill for me"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* people were dead... others were hurt, or scared..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* and then...... when mettaton died during his grand "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* .........\n"
"* i didn't know what to do"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* it felt like... my whole world came crashing "
"down......"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* and all i could do......... was watch it "
"happen............"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ..............."
msgstr "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ..............."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* as it turns out, though, a lot of people felt the same"
" way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* and all of us who did formed a support group for fans "
"of mettaton."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* remember his last words?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* \"you'll realize not everything's going to go your "
"way!\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... of course, he was wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* you escaped, and got away with what you did."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* even king asgore couldn't stop you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* but those nine words... became our group's mantra."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* we became united in our dislike for you, and what you "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* you're not just a human who did some bad things."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* you're an interloper who spat in the face of our way "
"of life."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* the new queen, undyne, would agree with us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... she took over after asgore disappeared."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* it's not like she was the biggest fan of mettaton, "
"but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* she definitely got behind what he said in the end."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* heh...... when toriel returned and begged undyne to "
"defend you......"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* she got laughed all the way back to the outlands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... people are pretty much united in their dislike for"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* just like everyone else does nowadays."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* the new queen, toriel, might disagree with us."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* it's not like she was against what mettaton said, "
"but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* she seemed to have a stubborn soft spot for humanity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* .........\n"
"* honestly, it's fine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* it hasn't stopped people from being united in their "
"dislike for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* eventually, our group noticed that asgore had yet to "
"be replaced"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* so...... one of our own members suggested we take the "
"throne ourselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* as the \"face\" of the group, i was appointed as the "
"outpost's official leader..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* but, in reality... we all kind of make decisions "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* it's pretty cool, actually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* a little weird having all these people look up to me, "
"but......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* at least none of us have to do this thing alone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* anyway, i just wanted you to know......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* i'm fine now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* better than fine, in fact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* oh, after alphys became queen, he figured he'd \"tag "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... right.\n"

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* so, after the former queen returned..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* she and i recognized each other and got to talking."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* one thing led to another, and..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* ... welp, you know more about these things than me."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* I do still worry about the outpost overall."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* well, yeah, but it's not like they can kick 'em out."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* they WERE still paying customers."

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I knew I could not afford to remain there any longer."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* I ran to the Citadel as fast as I could to stop him "

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* But when I got there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* I realized I had been wrong about him this whole "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* He was not the killer I had made him out to be."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* ..."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I had a talk with Alphys later that day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* We discussed ASGORE, the humans..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* As well as something about a \"Mew Mew Space "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/4}* I still do not know what that means."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Anyhoo, to summarize... she wasn't ready to become "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* And she agreed to appoint me instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Only then, did I hear about the Royal Guard captain's"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* And the fact that, had you acted, you might have "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* And the fact that you were the one to have killed "
"her."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* As well as the death of the TV star, Mettaton."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... and the deaths of most of the Royal Guard beyond "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Mettaton's death in particular was difficult, "

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Learning of his death was... difficult for me."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* As well as the death of Sans's brother, Papyrus."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* And that everyone else had been mistaken."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* But that was not the case, and I was wrong to think "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I only have my own cowardice to blame, however."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* If I had simply possessed the courage to leave "

msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* Alas, there was nothing more to be done."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* As queen, I did not have time to dwell on such "

"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* The humans' safety was at stake, and I would not lose"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* My first act as queen would be to increase their "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Admittedly, this would be difficult, given the lack "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Admittedly, I was out of practice in handling these "

"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* But with the help of an old friend, Gerson, and his "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I was able to arrange a minimal security detail here "

"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* In a way, I understand what ASGORE must have been "

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* The weight of such outrageous demands being made of "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ..."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (Doggo wants to talk to you.)\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Give me that thing!"

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ...\n"
"* So it's you, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who thought it'd be funny to pet us all!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Not that... I'm complaining."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* But... argh!\n"
"* I couldn't even see you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* That was so unfair."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Except for Doge.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I wonder what her secret is..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who thought you could get past us by throwing"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I mean, OK, it worked."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But it was really annoying when I found out!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Maybe..."
msgstr "<32>{#p/basic}* Tal vez..."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... we can play again sometime?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* No, no, forget I said that.\n"

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who tried to beat us all up!"

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You even managed to disappoint Canis Major..."

"<32>{#p/basic}* What's wrong with you!?\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... that's what the others would say."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* At least you made Canis Major happy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* So, maybe you're not all bad?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... to be honest, I didn't mind it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who pet me when I couldn't even see you!"

"<32>{#p/basic}* Wow!\n"

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But... that's just a fantasy."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who tried to beat me up!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I definitely didn't like that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Anyway!\n"
"* Did you hear about the humans we released!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* They were all asleep in some weird archive thing.\n"
"* It's way above my paw grade."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* All I know is, I get to take care of a human!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It was Doge's idea.\n"
"* We all get one human each."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* They're like pets???"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Don't worry, we don't mistreat them.\n"
"* They're under our protection!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Which is weird... since we were like, trying to hunt them "
"down before or something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Still, they kind of have to be."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* People REALLY seem to dislike humans these days."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/human}{#v/3}{@fill=#003cff}* You're going to miss the grand opening!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Guess I better go see what this is..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I get it, OK!?\n"
"* Heck, I'm almost there!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* What the...\n"
"* WHAT IS THAT THING!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* THAT WASN'T PART OF THE CITY'S SKYLINE BEFORE!!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/human}{#v/3}{@fill=#003cff}* It's your brand new dog shrine!\n"
"* Just like you wanted!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* It's... in constant motion..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* WELL THIS IS SOMETHING!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (Shrines, good for peace!)\n"
"* (Help relieve fears of being attacked by humans!)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... thanks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (And that's the last one!)\n"
"* (All council dogs have shrines now!)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* PERFECT!!\n"
"* Can I go back to my phone call now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#v/3}{@fill=#003cff}* I'll have to show the others!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* HEY!\n"
"* Before you go..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I wouldn't have seen it on time without you.\n"
"* Have a treat."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#v/3}{@fill=#003cff}* Master Doggo...!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Go on, tell your friends.\n"
"* BUT DON'T SHARE!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* So, around here, everyone understands how things work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* You visit the shrine, do a good job at work, and be good at "
"home, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* And maybe, if you're really really good, you'll get "
"rewarded!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It's perfect.\n"
"* Nobody breaks the rules."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Except those pesky shopkeepers at the rec center."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* THEY'RE JUST LAZY AND DISORGANIZED!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But they sell cool junk, so we give them a pass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Hold on.\n"
"* Are we giving anyone else a pass??"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* WHAT HAS OUR SOCIETY COME TO!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (Doggo, new job for you!)\n"
"* (Spider queen, stirring up trouble again.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (A punishment is required!)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ... ugh.\n"
"* I don't like disciplining people."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (Without discipline, dog society falls out of balance.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I guess.\n"
"* But can't someone else do it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (All council dogs must practice discipline.)\n"
"* (It's your turn!)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (Doggo, new job for you!)\n"
"* (Tall skeleton, deserving of bonus rewards.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (Offer them to him!)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ... ugh.\n"
"* I swear we give him bonus rewards every day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (Tall skeleton sets a very good example!)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* At this rate, he'll be on the dog council himself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (We are considering the possibility.)\n"
"* (Now do your duty!)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (Doggo, new job for you!)\n"
"* (Supplies of dog chow are running low.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (Can you help refill?)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ... ugh.\n"
"* Why do I get all the dirty work around here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (Doggo, only dog who doesn't mind dirty work.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Lies.\n"
"* Doge likes doing dirty jobs way more than me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (Doge cannot do this job.)\n"
"* (Doge is queen.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* OK.\n"
"* Fine."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Well, I guess I'll have to end the message here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Have fun out there, wherever you are."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ... I'd give the phone back to that annoying dog, but the "
"message would never end."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* HOW CAN YOU TALK FOR SO LONG WITHOUT GETTING TIRED!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* OK already!\n"
"* Quit rushing me!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Oh, hello, dearie~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Are you doing well?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Oh, who am I kidding~\n"
"* It's not like I cared about you anyway~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I just wanted to let you know about all the fun you're "
"missing out on!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* So, after you departed from the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* By line of succession, Alphys was put in charge as queen~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But you see, dearie, she didn't think she could do it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Don't blame her though~\n"
"* She let her pet TV star die such a tragic death!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Don't blame her though~\n"
"* Without big boy Asgore to hold her hand, she was helpless!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It's so unfortunate there was nobody left to take charge, "
"don't you think?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Lucky for her, I was more than willing to appoint myself~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ahuhuhu~\n"
"* She rejected me at first, but after a little \"persuasion...\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* She was quite eager to hand the outpost over to me!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* She held a meeting with the royal guards to hire someone "
"else, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Without their captain, they'd fallen into disorder!\n"
"* They needed direction~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ahuhuhu~\n"
"* Thankfully, I was more than willing to give it to them!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* And from there, the outpost was all but mine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}* With your killing and bullying, the people were made so "
"afraid and obedient~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* With your bullying, the people were made so afraid and "
"obedient~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Like they were just begging for a strong, assertive leader "
"to take her rightful place!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* It's incredible just how quickly they all came around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* For that, dearie, I have you to thank~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* Oh, come ON.\n"
"* You think you can just blame it all on THEM?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Oh, dearie...\n"
"* It's a shame you're not here to see this~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Not only do the people do whatever I want, whenever I "
"want..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But some of them even do it willingly!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Most of them still whine and complain like babies, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* Well GEE, I wonder why THAT might be."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Oh, Alphys-dear~\n"
"* Didn't I tell you to clean out the fluid network today?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* It's gotten so dirty after all these years..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* If you don't clean it, then who will?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/22}* I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY "
"QUALIFIED!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Oh, you ARE such a pest, aren't you~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* But... ahuhuhu~\n"
"* You know what happens to pests, don't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/2}* ... n-no, please, I..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/3}* I-I'll do it!\n"
"* You just watch me, I'll do it right now!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Too late, Alphys-dear~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Spiders, take her away!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It would seem she needs another stay in the Aurora Zone~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/22}* No, PLEASE!!\n"
"* I'LL DO ANYTHING!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* See you on the other side~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* Maybe you'd like to try."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Oh, but you know that'll never happen~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* And... ahuhuhu~\n"
"* Talk like that is what gets you in trouble, I'm afraid~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/27}* Oh, does it now?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/28}* Eheh...\n"
"* Maybe you'll be the one who's in trouble soon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Enough talk, Alphys-dear~\n"
"* I know exactly what kind of punishment you deserve!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/29}* Enjoy your last moments in power."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Like I'd fall for that~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ahuhuhu~\n"
"* Poor Alphys-dear, always getting into trouble~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It's a good thing we have the Aurora Zone to straighten out "
"her behavior!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* With the power of the archive, we can send a monster into a "
"virtual world~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Best of all, we control how time passes there~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Days, months, years..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* All going by in the blink of an eye!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* We spiders LOVE to make them suffer for a long time when "
"they misbehave!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* sorry to interrupt..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* i just came to let you know that i've done what you "

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* of course......\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* i guess........."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* it'd just be nice if... i knew what you were going to "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* You poor thing~\n"
"* You don't need to concern yourself with that!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Rest assured, everyone will get what they deserve in the "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ..."
msgstr "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ..."

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* i'd like to go rest now, it's been a long day"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* So would you say audiences are enjoying the new TV lineup?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/mettaton}* THE RATINGS ARE TERRIBLE.\n"
"* NOBODY LIKES IT."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Oh, wonderful!\n"
"* Like music to my ears~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* YOU KNOW..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* PEOPLE WANT VILLAINS, AND SOMEBODY TO ROOT AGAINST."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* PEOPLE WANT VARIETY, AND FAMOUS GUEST ROLES."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* NOT THE UTTER GARBAGE -YOU'RE- PUSHING ON EVERYONE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* The point isn't to give people what they "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Hmm..."
msgstr "<32>{#p/basic}* Hmm..."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Well, as long as the audiences can't stand it!"

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You royal guards... y-you're all the same!"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* people blamed each other for letting it all happen..."

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* for what you did to them..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but, over time, my brother really turned things around."

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}THE OUTPOST HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER!"

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}WHATEVER YOU MAY HAVE DONE, HUMAN..."

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}AND THAT I FORGIVE YOU!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}BECAUSE, EVEN IF WE GOT OFF TO A ROUGH START..."

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* aw, that's sweet."

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* it's too bad we won't get to hear their reaction."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/7}YEAH, WELL, IT'S STILL WORTH SAYING!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THEY HEARD IT."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* heh.\n"
"* take care of yourself out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* 'cause at least one person's rootin' for ya."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}... THAT'S ME!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* after you left, the king vanished into thin air."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* why?\n"
"* nobody knows."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* ... maybe he just went on vacation."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* anyway, alphys was supposed to replace him."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* but she didn't consider herself to be cut out for the "
"job."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* she thought about putting a royal guard in her place..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but those guys all but vanished, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* why?\n"
"* hard to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* ... maybe they just got bored of their jobs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but with their captain gone, they couldn't make up "
"their minds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* ... maybe undyne just couldn't be bothered anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* after that, alphys fled the citadel and left us without"
" a leader."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* you'd think the former queen might return, or..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* maybe someone overzealous would take the throne "
"instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* and yet, neither of those things happened."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* why?\n"
"* you tell me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* ... maybe all the potential leaders out there just gave"
" up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* regardless, i realized it'd be up to me to do "
"something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* so i took over for asgore and alphys myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* it hasn't been easy, what with all the leadership "
"troubles..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* not to mention keeping the humans' existence a secret."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but after i implemented my pro-slacker policy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* people seemed to relax quite a bit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* a far cry from how scared they were of being beat up "
"before."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* a far cry from how distraught they were about asgore "
"and undyne."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* all in all, things are going pretty well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* the humans are safe and sound, the citizens still have "
"hope..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* so what's the catch?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* why does it all feel so... hopeless?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* well, to be honest, it's anyone's guess."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{*}{#x0}{#p/darksans}{#f/1}{#i/5}* ... maybe you're just a dirty brother"
" killer."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/8}* Hiya..."
msgstr "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/8}* Hola..."

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* Is anyone there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* I hope it's not too much trouble..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/5}* I just wanted to let you know how things are going "
"out here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/11}* I didn't really feel like I'd be the best fit for "
"the job."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/alphys}{#f/5}* Well, I had a talk with some of the royal guards, "
"and..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* We agreed Terrestria should be appointed as the queen"
" instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/15}* Her first action was a little controversial, "
"though..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/17}* Cutting the Royal Guard in half and loosening its "
"policies."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/26}* Undyne wasn't happy about it at first, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/8}* She came around to it in the end."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/27}* Apparently she thinks not all humans are... bad now?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* Are you kidding?\n"
"* Of COURSE they're not all bad!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* U-Undyne!?"
msgstr "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* ¿¡U-Undyne!?"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* That last human proved their kind CAN fight with "
"honor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* That they CAN show respect to their opponents in "
"battle."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* ... and it's a good thing, too, because..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/14}* I doubt the Royal Guard will expand again any time "
"soon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Especially after the former queen returned, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* ... gave the new one her full support."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/14}* That last human proved their kind CAN in fact be... "
"well, kind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* That they CAN show mercy to their opponents in "
"battle."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/19}* Undyne... wasn't happy about this at all."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/19}* She still blames you for what happened to the king, "
"so..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* It's... understandable why she'd be opposed to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* Yeah, it's a pretty stupid policy if you ask me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* No matter HOW many nice humans come along, we CAN'T "
"lower our guard!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/9}* ... but not many people would agree with me these "
"days."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* With the former queen's return, and her support for "
"the new one..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/9}* I doubt the Royal Guard will ever be as strong as it "
"once was."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/5}* ...\n"
"* About the former queen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/alphys}{#f/5}* By the time she returned, things were mostly back to "
"normal..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* And then she decided to reveal the truth about the "
"humans."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* Like... RIGHT after she found out herself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* ... eheh...\n"
"* The people didn't react well at first."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/13}* They were more scared than anything..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/26}* A fact not helped by a certain human beating "
"everyone up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* Thankfully, over time, Terrestria was able to calm "
"them down..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/20}* ... by reminding them nobody had died."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/18}* I'm glad it worked.\n"
"* I would have caused a riot saying that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/8}* But... yeah, people are mostly positive about "
"humanity now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/15}* ... thankfully, this DIDN'T cause a mass uprising..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/17}* Though, I guess being so well-known helped her out "
"with that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/8}* In fact, people are mostly positive about humanity "
"now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/8}* So that's something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* Heh, tell me about it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/10}* It's a weird reality we live in now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* By the way, did you mention all the new schools being"
" built?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* Uh... yeah!\n"
"* I totally... didn't."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/10}* I just wish it didn't mean scaling back the Royal "
"Guard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* But... hey, at least those new schools are pretty "
"cool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* Oh yeah!\n"
"* I forgot you're a teacher there now!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* Eheh...\n"
"* The education system's doing well, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr "<32>* de hecho..."

msgid "<32>* ... would you like me to tell you a joke?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i don't have much of a sense of humor, but i can try..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* okay...\n"
"* here goes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* if a ghost gets tired in the middle of the road, what does it do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* answer... it {@fill=#ff0}naps to block{@fill=#fff} you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* get it?\n"
"* napstablook?\n"
"* naps to block?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* yeah...\n"
"* that was kinda bad"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... you wanted me to tell you another joke?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* hmm... let me think about it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* okay, let's see..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* if a ghost changed vessels so they could have a child, what would you "
"call it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* answer... a {@fill=#ff0}trans-parent.{@fill=#fff}."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... heh."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... you wanted me to tell you a third joke?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* well... if you insist..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* okay.\n"
"* i've got it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* if a restaurant hires a ghost to taste test their food, what does that"
" make the ghost?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* answer... a {@fill=#ff0}food-in-spectre.{@fill=#fff}."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* alright, alright.\n"
"* maybe i got a little carried away with that one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* but i hope you liked it anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* oh..."
msgstr "<32>* oh..."

msgid "<32>* ... i guess i'm at a loss for what to say."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* you've been such a good listener, i'd feel bad if i ran out of ideas."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* c'mon, blooky, think..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... what can you talk about..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* wait, hold on"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* do you know anything about ghost food?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that last joke kind of got me thinking about it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* you must be confused... it's not really explained anywhere."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* if you like, i can tell you about it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... so, ghost food..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it's exactly like normal monster food, except..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* when preparing it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* there's a special kind of spell you have to use to make it edible for "
"ghosts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that's right... any monster food can become ghost food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* as it turns out, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* certain kinds of food are easier to convert than others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* like... standard fruit.\n"
"* or milkshakes."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* but something like that exoberry pie you bought from me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* but something like that exoberry pie i had in my shop..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that... would take a lot of magical power to make."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* the more complicated the food, the more difficult it is to convert "
"into ghost food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* this one time, my... er, mettaton made me a chocolate "
"cake."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* this one time, my cousin made me a chocolate cake."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* chocolate filling, chocolate icing... chocolate everything."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* if i didn't know any better, i'd think it was actual human food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* but somehow, he managed to convert all of that into a ghost food..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* not for a special occasion, but just because he wanted to see me "
"smile."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* but somehow, they managed to convert all of that into a ghost food..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* not for a special occasion, but just because they wanted to see me "
"smile."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* well... i did.\n"
"* and we ate the cake together."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* and i was happy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* heh...\n"
"* i think i'm gonna pretend to sleep for a while..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it helps me unwind after a long day like this one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... wait, it's morning..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i guess that would make it a long night, then."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* days and nights...\n"
"* that's going to take some getting used to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* well... thanks for talking to me, frisk"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* feel free to lay down next to me... if you like......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Zzz... Zzz..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* Zzz... Zzz..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* This ghost keeps saying 'z' out loud repeatedly, pretending "

msgstr ""

msgid "* (Lay down next to it?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes"
msgstr "Sí"

msgid "No"
msgstr "No"

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The ghost is still here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oooooooooooo......"
msgstr "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oooooooooooo......"

msgid "<32>* this is really nice......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (You feel... something.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* oh, sorry... i should probably explain what this is..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ...\n"
"* so, uh..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* i took your body...\n"
"* as a vessel..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* and now...... we inhabit the same space......"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* i don't know why, but the last human who tried this... really liked "
"it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* so..."
msgstr "<32>* entonces..."

msgid "<32>* maybe you will too..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* well, we can stay like this as long as you don't try "
"to move."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* so...\n"
"* only try to move around when you want it to end, i guess."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* well...\n"
"* i hope you liked that..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* or at least found it kind of interesting..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* or something..."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Are you ready to go outside?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (But you didn't feel like wasting your time here.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* The computer's offline, but there's an empty slot for a "
"computer chip."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Insert the Computer Chip?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You decide not to insert.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ah!\n"

"* Thank you so much!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* You really took care of me!\n"
"* You have found a computer very far away indeed!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I have established a link between this computer and my body on the "

msgstr ""

"<32>* I never could have imagined how it would feel to exist in two places "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It is... incredible..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of strange..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... but who am I kidding, this is you we're talking about."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You'd sleep in a doggy bed if you had the choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And you'd eat the dog food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* And you'd like it if somebody tried to pet you whilst eating said dog "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I'd offer you a treat, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Even with my new ability to appear visually, I'm still just a ghost."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Oh, right.\n"
"* My new ability."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I tried showing myself to Asriel like before, but he couldn't see "
"me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So it looks like it only works for you right now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Still.\n"
"* Better than nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* At least you can actually walk up to and talk to me now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Like that, for example."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Or that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Or even that!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You can stop now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* There's more to your room than me, isn't there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Maybe not."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Maybe I'm all you've got."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* In which case..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* We'll be here for a long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A very long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A very, very long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A very, very long time indeed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Don't you have anything better to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Ah, the humble hallway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* For Asriel and I, it was the starting point of countless adventures..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* ... running dauntlessly across the various rooms of the house."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I know, right?\n"
"* So very adventurous."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Sadly, we had to stop after the mirror got smashed in for the seven "
"hundredth time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You wouldn't believe the excuses I'd come up with..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Like when I blamed a particle collider for shooting a stray atom from "
"Earth to the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* And somehow only hitting the glass because it \"phased\" through the "
"wall."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah... that one might've been a stretch."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Nowadays, though, hallways are just hallways."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And excuses are just excuses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Is there a valuable life lesson in there somewhere?\n"
"* Probably."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I will say, there's a kind of symbolism to a ghost in a hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With the whole \"between one place and another\" thing going on."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Actually, that probably only applies to human ghosts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Monster ghosts are just born like that naturally..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* So, if anything, they'd be in the room at the beginning of the "
"hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... rather than standing in the middle of it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Sorry.\n"
"* Went on a tangent there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But what did you expect me to go on when you spoke to me in a boring "
"hallway?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Boring hallway, boring tangent.\n"
"* That makes sense, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Or maybe it doesn't.\n"
"* What do I know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Apart from the fact that I've run out of things to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* That, I know for sure."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But what can you do?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ... wait, I know!\n"
"* We could go to a new room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Ooh... Asgore's room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The big guy sure loves his diaries, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Even though he hasn't written anything into that one yet, I'm sure "
"he'll do so soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Reading them has always been a guilty pleasure of mine..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* What?\n"
"* Everyone's got some kind of guilty pleasure, don't they?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder what yours would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Maybe I'll find out later."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* For now, though, I'll just be hanging around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Watching, waiting..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... ready to catch you the moment you do something you don't want me "
"to see!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Okay, maybe I wouldn't actually go that far."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* Not while you're awake, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I took a peek outside, and they're STILL working on "
"construction."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The whole front of the house is STILL a big mess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And Asgore's... STILL tending to the ground..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... while the former CORE workers take their sweet, sweet time "
"building the porch."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder what it'll look like when it's done..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Hopefully, with Asgore in charge, it'll look better than what we've "
"had before."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Actually, Asgore's only in charge of the design."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Since construction started yesterday, Doge has been the one giving the"
" orders."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I snuck outside then, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She's strict, but she seems to know what she's doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Which is great, because as much as I love Asgore for who he is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He most certainly is NOT your ideal foreman."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}* Speaking of things being built, they finished the balcony "
"earlier this morning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Monster Kid and Asriel are both outside...\n"
"* ... sightseeing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* They sure do that a lot together... they're probably waiting for you "
"to join them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Once you're done taking in YOUR surroundings, you could go see them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Or you could just go back to your room.\n"
"* Whatever floats your hoverboat."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Oh yeah, about boats..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I guess those aren't really needed around here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But... Frisk!\n"
"* There are places on this world you can't be without one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Especially the bog basins.\n"
"* All that murky water..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Just keep it in mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* And no, you can't just get by swimming in those kinds of "
"places."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Only some of them.\n"
"* And only at a good time of day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Mind you, do monsters even have a sense of the time of day?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Most WERE born in space..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... maybe that's a question for another time of day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Three little chairs at the dining table..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* One for you, one for Asriel, and one for Monster Kid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* That's fine, really.\n"
"* Asgore wouldn't know I'm here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Still..."
msgstr "<32>* Aún así..."

msgid "<32>* It does feel strange not to have a place there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Asriel and I loved to swap the chairs around when Mom wasn't"
" looking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Even Asgore would get in on it sometimes.\n"
"* She... wasn't impressed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But it was all in good fun."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Heck, he used to check under Asriel's chair for space creatures when "
"he sat down."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I'll never forget that time Toriel sat down on the chair, which we "
"swapped beforehand..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Asgore gave her the exact same treatment, and it was GLORIOUS."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* All of us were laughing... except for Toriel, who sat there in "
"disbelief."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Well.\n"
"* She came around to it later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* But, yeah... she wasn't much for the chicanery we got up to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And even if she's not the same as she used to be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And even if she won't be here all the time..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* It's a good thing Asriel's got someone like you to calm him down."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* When he gets excited, he gets REALLY excited."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... or, used to, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I guess it's unfair to think of him as the same person he "
"once was."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With all that stuff he mentioned about trying to corrupt you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With all that stuff he mentioned about hurting you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He's probably a very different person by now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not unlike myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I just hope he can make the best of what he has, now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And that you'll be there for him when he needs you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But I guess I'm starting to repeat myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* We've got a home, we've got sunlight... so there's no reason to "
"complain!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... or something like that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Of course they put a microwave in here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Of course they did."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* No doubt that'll be Asriel's primary source of food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah, he's what you'd call a \"microwave master.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I mean, it's bad enough that so many of our ingredients are "
"replicated these days..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Formed with matter-energy conversion nonsense, rather than legitimate "
"cooking."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But at least that can still produce something palletable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Using the microwave is just..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's so very wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* I mean, that's just my opinion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* You can feel free to disagree, and knowing you, you probably do..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But some opinions..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Let's just say some opinions are more correct than others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* All we can hope for is that Eurybia has a better selection "
"of fresh ingredients."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Considering Alphys was the one to seek out planets in the first "
"place..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You can't blame me for being at least a little wary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}* If Asriel's a microwave master, Alphys would be a microwave "
"overlord."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's all I'm saying."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* No, really."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Won't say anything more."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Not in the kitchen, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The balcony's just outside..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder if the birds are saying anything interesting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Like \"what a nice house!\"\n"
"* Or \"the weather's great today.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Maybe they don't like the house OR the weather.\n"
"* That'd be... kind of sad."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Maybe they're not even birds.\n"
"* Who knows what kinds of sounds birds make here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Who knows if birds even exist here at all."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* For all we know, what we're hearing are the cries of the damned buried"
" deep underground."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* After the monsters have lived here long enough, the planet "
"might gain some form of magic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If that happens, would the animals be affected, too?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Would they become conscious?\n"
"* Understand us?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Would we understand them?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* If the sounds we're hearing really ARE cries of the damned, I'm not "
"sure I'd want to know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But yeah, planetary magic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I think that's what happened to Krios, when monsters first gained "
"THEIR magic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Either that, or the planet already had magic, and gave it to them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We'd have to ask Terrestria about that sort of thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She'd know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Hey.\n"
"* Don't be nervous about going out there, Frisk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm sure those two would be happy to see you there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And if my analysis of the position is right..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The planet itself will, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Don't quote me on that, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm not much of a chess player."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* The smartest move I've ever played in a board game was a "
"double-jump in checkers."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It was downhill from there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* And if we weren't buried in a jungle, it might be downhill "
"from here, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not that I blame Asgore for choosing such a low-risk location."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He's got two adopted children to think about now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not to mention his own son."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Mountainside living might be cool, but the jungle has its "
